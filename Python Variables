# = in programming means "assigned to" Exple  5 is assigned to variable x 
# LEGAL VARIABLE NAMES 
# A variable name must start with a letter or underscore and it must be lowercase 
# A variable cannot startwith a number. 
# IS CASE SENSITIVE AND CANNOT CONTAIN ALPHA NUMERIC (AGE # age)

# many values to mltiple variable
#python allows you to assign many values to multiple variables

#concatination is to combine two strings you can use the + operator

#Python Boolean
#It uses two values true or false, it evaluates any expression true or false, python then evaluates and return boolean answer.

#OPERATOR 
#Examples
x = 15
y = 2
print (x % y)
#print (x % y)
print (x // y) #Floor division rounds up to the nearest whole number

print (x ** y) #same as 2+2+2+2+2
